                The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. 
                It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
                It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in). 
                It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; 
                although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
